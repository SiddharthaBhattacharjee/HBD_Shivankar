# HBD_Shivankar
This app is a birthday gift for my friend Shivankar Paul, All my friends have contributed by sending their wishes and making the images and videos I used in the app, So thanks too all my friends who have helped.<br>

#Instructions:
* Download just the apk file to try out the app.
* Read all the instructions in the app to clear the levels.
* Some level include personal questions , here are the answers to those levels :: Lvl 5 answer : computerscience , Lvl 6 answer : shivankar,wasim,inam,debo,joysri,mukta,krishna,siddhartha,anamika,shainara
* Level 9 answer involves some decoding and finding the clues stuff , so best of luck finding that :) Here are some hints if you are stuck : 1) look closely at the white texts starting with $ sign, 2) Frontman introduces himself in the starting lines of the app, decode his name from there 3) Check all level names for decoding.
* In case you can't find the secret level , its the pic of Frontman (red hooded man) in home screen.
* Home screen refers to home screen of the app, please don't start checking your phones home screen like some people did :)

Hope you like the game : ) Give it a try...
