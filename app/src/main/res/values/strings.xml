        You can see 10 icons in your screen each with one of your friend in it, each of them is locked and you will have to complete challenges and solve puzzles to unlock them. Your task is to open all the icons before 2 Hours… or else… There will be consequences , There is a ransomware injected in the phones of everyone you see in your screen , After 2 hours , whoever\'s icon is still not unlocked , their phone and all their data will be locked forever , The safety of your friend\'s phones and data is in your hand… This is not a joke , there is real ransomware involved and the only way to avoid it is  to unlock the icons.\n
